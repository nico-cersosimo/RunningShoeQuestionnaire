# RunningShoeQuestionnaire
a personal project I'm working on ran on a local host web page using Microsoft Visual Studio and MS SQL. Allows the user to fill out a questionnaire to gain an idea of running shoe preferences such as the type of terrain he/she runs on, the range of cos they are willing to pay, etc.. It then stores they're completed form into the SQL database and then retrieves it by ID to filter down a list of brands to recommend based on his/her answers. *CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS*
